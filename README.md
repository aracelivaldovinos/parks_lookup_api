_This project practices building an API for national parks and birds. The API will list national parks and birds and will meet the following instructions:_
_For your final Ruby/Rails code review, you may build one of the three APIs below. (You may also build an API of your choosing if you prefer.)_

* _Animal Shelter: Create an API for a local animal shelter. The API will list the available cats and dogs at the shelter._
* _Local Business Lookup: Create an API for a local business lookup. The API will list restaurants and shops in town._

_You have the freedom to build out your APIs as you wish. At the very least, your API should include the following:_
* _Full CRUD functionality._
* _Further exploration of one of the following objectives: authentication, versioning, pagination, Swagger documentation, or CORS._
* _Complete documentation of API endpoints and the further exploration you did._

4. _Open Text Editor and Server_
* _Open cloned folder in the editor of your choice_
* _To run test use `rspec` on the root directory of the cloned project command line_
